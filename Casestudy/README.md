# DIGITAL TEMPERATURE SENSOR
## Introduction
 --- The project is a temperature sensor made with an Arduino UNO and LM35 sensor and a few other components. The main aim of the project is to detect the temperature of the surroundings and display it on the LCD.


## SWOT ANALYSIS
**Strength**
-- User can detect the temperature of the surroundings.

**Weakness**
-- Less rugged in a high vibration environment.

**Opportunity**
-- user can detect digital readings.

**Threats**
-- low sensitivity.

# 4W&#39;s and 1&#39;H
