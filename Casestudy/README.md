# CASE STUDY 1
# DIGITAL TEMPERATURE SENSOR
## Introduction
 --- The project is a temperature sensor made with an Arduino UNO and LM35 sensor and a few other components. The main aim of the project is to detect the temperature of the surroundings and display it on the LCD.


## SWOT ANALYSIS
**Strength**
-- User can detect the temperature of the surroundings.

**Weakness**
-- Less rugged in a high vibration environment.

**Opportunity**
-- user can detect digital readings.

**Threats**
-- low sensitivity.

# 4W&#39;s and 1&#39;H

## Who:

**Everyone can detect temperature using digital temperature sensors.**

## What:

**Digital Temperature Sensors is mainly concerned to detect the temperature of the surroundings.**

## When:

**TBD**

## Where:

**User can use this sensors in varying climate environment.**

## How:

**Implementation is done using Arduino Uno.**

# Detail requirements
## High Level Requirements:
-- ID | Description | Status (Implemented/Future)
----- | ------------|---------------------------
HLR1| User can detect temperature| Implemented
HLR2| User can see the readings in LCD display| Implemented
HLR3| Temperature measured in celsius| Implemented



##  Low level Requirements:
-- ID | Description | Status (Implemented/Future)
----- | ------------|---------------------------
LLR1| User can detect temperature in all environment | Implemented





# CASE STUDY 2
# BIOMETRIC ATTENDANCE SYSTEM
## Introduction
 --- Biometrics is the emerging technology used for identification. Biometric refers to automatic identification of a person based on biological characters such as finger print, iris, facial recognition, etc. In this article finger print based attendance system is proposed. Attendance in educational institutions, industries will require more paper work and time. To reduce this, automatic attendance system using finger print was developed. We also call it as Biometric Attendance System

## SWOT ANALYSIS
**Strength**
-- User can mark their attendance easily using fingerprint.

**Weakness**
-- Modules are sensitive and they need to be handled carefully.

**Opportunity**
-- This can be used in educational institutions.

**Threats**
-- There is a chance of misusing the technology by placing a fake finger print.

# 4W&#39;s and 1&#39;H

## Who:

**Everyone can use this to mark attendance.**

## What:

**Biometric attendance system is mainly concerned to take the attendance and display when requested.**

## When:

**TBD**

## Where:

**Biometrics can be used in ATM for authentication.**

## How:

**Implementation is done using Atmega8 microcontroller.**

# Detail requirements
## High Level Requirements:
-- ID | Description | Status (Implemented/Future)
----- | ------------|---------------------------
HLR1| User can mark attendance biometrically| Implemented
HLR2| User can see the attendance when needed| Implemented


##  Low level Requirements:
-- ID | Description | Status (Implemented/Future)
----- | ------------|---------------------------
LLR1| Finger print authentication can be used in access control. | Implemented

# Applications
* This can be used in educational institutions.
* Biometric attendance system can be used in industries.
* Biometrics can be used in ATM for authentication.
* Finger print authentication can be used in access control.
